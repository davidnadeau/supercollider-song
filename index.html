<p>The song is 2 minutes in length, composed of sounds and instruments.</p>
  <p>
  It begins with 10 seconds of a custom synth called the SinPulser. The SinPulser takes no parameters, and oscilates the freqency of a
  sine wave by sending the frequency through 2 rate based value generators. The order of value generators and the final processing through 
  a reverb generator leads to a very eiry mysterious sound.
  </p>
  <p>
  It then plays a chiptune like song for around 18 seconds using a custom chiptune synth. The frequency of the notes are based on a supercollider scale in attempts
  create a musical sounding pattern. The chiptune synth takes 2 parameters. The frequency of the note, and the frequency of the amplitude pulse.
  The larger the amplitude pulse, the more the notes will overlap. Using a pulse wave, a pulse oscilator is used to create grains of the pulse wave.
  The pulse grain has reverb applied and is enveloped.
  </p>
  <p>
  Then 20 seconds of ambient noises created with another custom synth. This synth is called ambientBackground and has 3 parts. The first part is a saw wave with the
  frequency chosen at a rate by a random value generator. Reverb is added to this sound. This was used to create strange quite complex sounds. Then a sine wave is used
  to create more simple constant oscilating noise. The frequency of the sine wave is chosen at a rate by a random value generator at a frequency determined by pink noise.
  Lastly a pulse wave is used, with frequencies genrated at a rate by a random value generator at a frequency determnined by pink noise. All these noises then have reverb 
  added to them. The result is ominous and dynamic, rarely ever sounding the exact same.
